# LakotaFontsRepo
A Lakota Language Font List

This is the repository where the fonts used by the Lakota Font - Mobile app are stored. It contains only free fonts, and the app depends on this directory to be online in order to download the required files. Without this repository the app's main functionality will be broken.

If you feel that your font is being wrongly or unfairly used, please contact us and I will kindly remove it as soon as possible. Thanks :)

Thank you to ItsPriyess for allowing us to adapt this from the Fontster app and font repository.
